# NIST_scrapping
Ionic Liquids Database Scrapper : Very rough and unreadable. Not capable of proper modular use. Data pulled from - https://ilthermo.boulder.nist.gov/

Chemical Properties Scrapper : More elegant and usable. Currently able to plot two properties of a molecule against each other at isothermal conditions. Molecule must be in this NIST database - https://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/fluid/. Currently only supports the units NIST defualts to. More functionality, (i.e non-defualt units, isobaric or other conditions, no plotting just outputting desired data to a csv) to be added as needed.

NOTE: This program requires that a chromedriver is installed and is in the system PATH. - http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
